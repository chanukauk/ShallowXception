# ShallowXception Model with Pretrained Weights Transfer

This package provides a modular implementation of a ShallowXception Xception-based model with different depths, allowing for the easy building of a deep learning model and transfer of pretrained weights from the original Xception model. This is particularly useful for fine-tuning and extending Xception's capabilities to new datasets and tasks.
